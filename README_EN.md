# 🍳 HowToCook-py-MCP 🥘 -- Your Weekly Meal Planner

English | [简体中文](./README.md)

> Turn your AI assistant into a personal chef that plans your daily meals!

This is a Python version of the recipe assistant MCP service, implemented using the FastMCP library. Based on [Anduin2017/HowToCook](https://github.com/Anduin2017/HowToCook), it enables AI assistants to recommend recipes and plan meals, solving the age-old question of "what to eat today"!

Special thanks to [worryzyy/HowToCook-mcp](https://github.com/worryzyy/HowToCook-mcp), as this Python version was inspired by their implementation 😄!
